The fastq files contained in this folder are from Minion runs sequencing Campanula americana individuals from various populations. The sequence data was mapped to C. ameriana's reference chloroplast genome with only the mapped reads kept. The result fastq files were then checked for run length when assembling in Flye, and then subset to ensure all files run in 20 minutes or less.
